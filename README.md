  It was just a normal day doing normal, everyday things. My first task of the day was waking up at 6am and taking a shower, eating breakfast at 6:30am, and then hopping on the bus by 7am on my way to school. I lived a decent middle-class life that never changed much. It seemed that everything was stuck in the same rythmatic cycle everyday. I sometimes hoped something would happen that would shake up this dull cycle. I finally arrived at school after the same bus ride and walked in to see my friends that at least made my day somewhat interesting.
